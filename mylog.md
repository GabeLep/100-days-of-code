# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 1 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started again with my FreeCodeCamp learning from the very beginning with the emphasis on completing my Front-End Developer Certification.
Had to also learn how to use Github and I think I may have it down.
After going through the learning again and realising that my progress on fCC was not being altered on the graph due to my previous attempt, I opted to have it all erased in order for me to see my actual progress, as I am a visual person. So I now wait for the team at fCC to respond and then I will begin again.

**Thoughts:** It was a lot easier to begin again with fCC and feel I will accomplish more with it now than I did in the past. I also saw that I started on fCC exactly 8 months ago and never completed my Front-End Developer Certification but now I am not only determined to achieve that but to be good enough at JavaScript by the end of the 100 Days to get interviewed for a few jobs. 

I feel more confident in myself now.

### Day 2: 2 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** After being very tired and drained from the gym, I managed to complete 30 minutes, despite it needing to be an hour. I felt that I was ot being productive and not retaining any knowledge, so I retired to bed even earlier than usual.

**Thoughts:** I think it would definitely be to my advantage to wake up an hour earlier and code in the morning, but I will have to see how that goes. Was not feeling motivated at all and that's due to all the stuff going but I will have to soldier-on, despite how I feel or how tired I am.

### Day 3: 3 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** I finally removed ALL of my previous fCC progress as I wanted to see my progress graphically on a daily basis. It was getting to me and I finally decided to just erase it all and I was amazingly happy about it. I completed the *HTML5 and CSS* section on fCC after 2 and a half days which makes me feel pretty good.

**Thoughts:** I am definitely feeling better especially after yesterday and I am looking forward to starting my projects pretty soon. I am going to be looking for additional projects outside of those on fCC to complete as well as some pages I can use as a reference point to redo and style as they are, in order to start doing more and not just read theory.

### Day 4: 4 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** I just learn a valauble lesson that I should always copy my entry to a work document before committing it as it may disappear completely. I have successully complete the *Responsive Design with Bootstrap* on fCC. Tomorrow I tackle *jQuery* and then into *JavaScript*.

**Thoughts:** I feel a lot better that I did yesterday. Coding every day for at least an hour does really boost one's morale and confidence and will certainly be setting myself up for success in the future. I also know that building extra projects will push me out of my comfort zone and will force me to learn at a faster pace than just reading about a particular framework or library. Exciting time lie ahead.

### Day 5: 5 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Today I  successully complete the *jQuery* on fCC. From tomorrow I will be tackling the *Tribute Page* as well as my personal *Portfolio page* which will in-turn become my porfolio website.

**Thoughts:** Today was a busy day. I learned that you have to be disciplined in your time and let **NOTHING** distract you or disturb you during your time. I am surprised that I was able to code especially on a Saturday with all that is going on during weekend. This gives me the confidence that I will be able to code at least one hour a day no matter what. I also learned that making notes helps with retaining the knowledge as well as helping me understand the syntax a lot better. i feel good with how this week went and I cannot wait for the new week to learn all I can and to apply it.
