# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 1 August 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started again with my FreeCodeCamp learning from the very beginning with the emphasis on completing my Front-End Developer Certification.
Had to also learn how to use Github and I think I may have it down.
After going through the learning again and realising that my progress on fCC was not being altered on the graph due to my previous attempt, I opted to have it all erased in order for me to see my actual progress, as I am a visual person. So I now wait for the team at fCC to respond and then I will begin again.

**Thoughts:** It was a lot easier to begin again with fCC and feel I will accomplish more with it now than I did in the past. I also saw that I started on fCC exactly 8 months ago and never completed my Front-End Developer Certification but now I am not only determined to achieve that but to be good enough at JavaScript by the end of the 100 Days to get interviewed for a few jobs. 

I feel more confident in myself now.
