# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 14 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Restarted my count for the #100DaysOfCode because I had missed Friday and Sunday. I decided to stick to the rules and rather restart instead of cheating myself in the end. I got through the basics of JavaScript variables and operators. Before restarting, I did complete my fCC Personal Portfolio Page.

**Thoughts:** As simple as they variables and operators are, they are very important as they are the basis of JavaScript logic, in my thinking. I think it is also very important to **PLAN** your time effciently because you will easily miss the time for your coding and before you know it, you will go **DAYS** without coding. I'm glad I got back quickly and not have given too much time. I will continue daily to learn and build projects as that is the promise I made to myself.

### Day 2: 15 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** I began with some of the JacaScript learning at it was difficult at first but I go through it. 

**Thoughts:** Felt better with today. I was struggling to get through some of the JavaScript but I decided to slow down, think about the problem and what I want to see and then it became easier. This reminds me that you cannot rush through a problem but have to take the time to creatively think about it and for it to make sense, even if you have to write it on paper first before creating the code for it.

### Day 3: 16 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed some fCC learning on Arrays, including *.push(), .pop.(), .shift() and .unshift()*. 

**Thoughts:** Really struggled in the beginning but I managed to get through it because I decided to stick it out, no matter how difficult the problem may look. Also learnt that I learn better when I write things on paper first before I type them out. I guess that is how I am wired and I enjoy it. I have an fCC booklet FULL of notes to help me remember and it has really become something I cherish.

**Consistency is key!!!**

### Day 4: 17 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Learned more JS regarding returns. global and local scope and did a few functions which are pretty amazing.

**Thoughts:** Even though I am extremely exhausted after this day, I still kept to my promise to myself to complete at least an hour of coding and to keep my momentum going.
I felt really good but not much was going in because of the mental fatigue but I am glad I did do the hour at the least.

### Day 5: 18 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked through some comparisons using operators such as *Greater Than, Equals, Strict Equals, Inequality and Strict Inequality*. Also learned about the if statements (the basic one) and how you can have two if statements that are in the same function.

**Thoughts:** There is definitely a lot to learn, process and do, but the momentum is definitely there and I would be a fool to lose it. I have been writting more before I code and that helps me think of the structure of the code first as well as learn the correct syntax before applying it to an editor. I am looking forward to building my projects soon as I have a lot more confidence in my ability but will have to first test that out by actually building something.
Exciting times ahead.

### Day 6: 19 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked through fCC JavaScript and the focs was on *LOGICAL AND **(&&)** and LOGICAL OR **(||)*** operators.

**Thoughts:** Learned a lot about thinking systematically when writing code and thinking the problem out loud then on paper. It is also important to read the instructions VERY well as a single letter can cause your code not to return correctly. I feel great and a little more confident that yesterday as I managed to write an if statement without the aid of any resources and is a major achievement for me.

### Day 7: 20 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed *Else If Statements, Switch Statements and Replacing If Else Chains with a Switch Statement*. 

**Thoughts:** I love how my thinking is changing as I am now thinking of the problem in its most basic form first and then applying logic to that problem. I was able to complete the *Golf Game* without seekign assistance and by thinking the problem out loud. That REALLY boosted my confidence and makes me want to return and learn even more.
