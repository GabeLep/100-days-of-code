# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 14 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Restarted my count for the #100DaysOfCode because I had missed Friday and Sunday. I decided to stick to the rules and rather restart instead of cheating myself in the end. I got through the basics of JavaScript variables and operators. Before restarting, I did complete my fCC Personal Portfolio Page.

**Thoughts:** As simple as they variables and operators are, they are very important as they are the basis of JavaScript logic, in my thinking. I think it is also very important to **PLAN** your time efficiently because you will easily miss the time for your coding and before you know it, you will go **DAYS** without coding. I'm glad I got back quickly and not have given too much time. I will continue daily to learn and build projects as that is the promise I made to myself.

### Day 2: 15 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** I began with some of the JavaScript learning at it was difficult at first but I go through it. 

**Thoughts:** Felt better with today. I was struggling to get through some of the JavaScript but I decided to slow down, think about the problem and what I want to see and then it became easier. This reminds me that you cannot rush through a problem but have to take the time to creatively think about it and for it to make sense, even if you have to write it on paper first before creating the code for it.

### Day 3: 16 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed some fCC learning on Arrays, including *.push(), .pop.(), .shift() and .unshift()*. 

**Thoughts:** Really struggled in the beginning but I managed to get through it because I decided to stick it out, no matter how difficult the problem may look. Also learnt that I learn better when I write things on paper first before I type them out. I guess that is how I am wired and I enjoy it. I have an fCC booklet FULL of notes to help me remember and it has really become something I cherish.

**Consistency is key!!!**

### Day 4: 17 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Learned more JS regarding returns. global and local scope and did a few functions which are pretty amazing.

**Thoughts:** Even though I am extremely exhausted after this day, I still kept to my promise to myself to complete at least an hour of coding and to keep my momentum going.
I felt really good but not much was going in because of the mental fatigue but I am glad I did do the hour at the least.

### Day 5: 18 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked through some comparisons using operators such as *Greater Than, Equals, Strict Equals, Inequality and Strict Inequality*. Also learned about the if statements (the basic one) and how you can have two if statements that are in the same function.

**Thoughts:** There is definitely a lot to learn, process and do, but the momentum is definitely there and I would be a fool to lose it. I have been writing more before I code and that helps me think of the structure of the code first as well as learn the correct syntax before applying it to an editor. I am looking forward to building my projects soon as I have a lot more confidence in my ability but will have to first test that out by actually building something.
Exciting times ahead.

### Day 6: 19 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked through fCC JavaScript and the focs was on *LOGICAL AND **(&&)** and LOGICAL OR **(||)*** operators.

**Thoughts:** Learned a lot about thinking systematically when writing code and thinking the problem out loud then on paper. It is also important to read the instructions VERY well as a single letter can cause your code not to return correctly. I feel great and a little more confident that yesterday as I managed to write an if statement without the aid of any resources and is a major achievement for me.

### Day 7: 20 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed *Else If Statements, Switch Statements and Replacing If Else Chains with a Switch Statement*. 

**Thoughts:** I love how my thinking is changing as I am now thinking of the problem in its most basic form first and then applying logic to that problem. I was able to complete the *Golf Game* without seeking assistance and by thinking the problem out loud. That REALLY boosted my confidence and makes me want to return and learn even more.

### Day 8: 21 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Did not do much coding as I heard terrible news and could not focus at all. I managed to complete 30 minutes of coding today.

### Day 9: 23 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Began with Objects today with some dot and bracket notation. Yesterday I was at a coding meet up and we began our first project as a team. Skipped yesterday but still did some coding with the team.

**Thoughts:** Taking it super slow as I have to prepare for more sadness on Saturday but I am making progress nonetheless. Really loving JavaScript and what it is capable of.

### Day 10: 24 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Did some JavaScript learning on fCC. Went through a few of the objects but was struggling with *Using Objects for Lookups* but I finally got through that over some time.

**Thoughts:** Learning the syntax is the easy part of any language. Like learning words of a new language. The critical part is learning to think like a programmer and I can see I am slowly developing that skill which is very necessary but I also know that it takes time to develop it. This week has been a difficult one but I have managed to stick to my challenge and to code daily.

### Day 11: 25 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Did some *Testing Objects for Properties* and it took me a while to grasp it as I was preparing to go to the funeral in the morning. Focus was seriously lacking.

**Thoughts:** It is difficult to concentrate when you have lost a friend to a senseless crime but I had to get some work in and I did the best I could. Each day is getting better and my coding is matching up to my feelings.

### Day 12: 26 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished with some *Accessing Nested Objects* and *Accessing Nested Arrays*. I will be beginning with loops tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Was at my friend's funeral today and it was **EXTREMELY painful** but I need to be strong as his unexpected death taught me a lot. I will push harder and make time for those around me.

### Day 13: 27 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Did some fCC JavaScript Loops, looking at *For Loops* and a *While Loop*.

**Thoughts:** It is all about the conditions that a passed through the loop that make it powerful. The fact that one can nest loops within each other makes them even more powerful. I will have to make more use of them to fully understand them and how to use them in a use case. The challenges are definitely getting more advanced but I look forward to the challenge each day and to be able to build powerful tools with the knowledge that I am currently gaining.

### Day 14: 28 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Almost done with Basic JavaScript. Learned how to do a *Profile LookUp* and how to *Generate random numbers (both fractions and whole numbers*. 

**Thoughts:** The more I do JavaScript, the more I think of how I will be able to use it in real life solutions for things around me. It is a really powerful language. Each day gets better and I am learning not to doubt my thinking and how I frame the solution in my mind because more times than ever I am correct.

### Day 15: 29 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed *Basic JavaScript* on fCC and began with some *Object Oriented and Functional Programming*. 

**Thoughts:** I did not know much about OOP until I did it today and I **LOVE** it. I find it a lot more user-friendly but I do realise that it also has its places like all the functions, if and else if statements. A lot to learn and I am excited to learn it and put it into practice.

### Day 16: 30 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed *Object Oriented and Functional Programming* on fCC and will be beginning with Algorithm challenges as from tomorrow. 

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed the OOP but I am very nervous about the Algorithms as I do not know what to expect and it seems very daunting. I look forward to tackling it all, one day at a time.

### Day 17: 31 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Begun *Algorithms* on fCC.

**Thoughts:** Wow. I did not expect what I faced. It was a lot more than I thought in terms of processing and thinking and I was not ready but I have to keep my head up high and do the best I can. Thinking like a programmer is NOT easy. It is a skill that has to be obtained over time and it will certainly take time to cultivate it and to hone it.

### Day 18: 1 September 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued with *Algorithms* on fCC.

**Thoughts:** They are still not easy but the thinking is getting easier. Now I can articulate the problem better but I am still in need of researching a lot more before I can work out the problem and the solution. It seems a lot better to say it out loud first but also to write down the code while saying it out loud. I may sound odd to other but this really does help.

Tomorrow I continue.

### Day 19: 2 September 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued with *Algorithms* on fCC.

**Thoughts:** The Algorithms help with the thinking. It is just knowing which functions to use as I have not yet used some of them like the *.slice()* function but my thinking is getting a lot better. I am now able to articulate what it is I want to do and the steps to do it. It is just learning to write the code to make it happen. Today was a good day.

### Day 20: 3 September 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued with *Algorithms* on fCC.

**Thoughts:** Not really focused today as it is my anniversary mini-getaway. The Algorithms today needed simple solutions but we do tend to over-complicate the solution. It's learning what methods to use when and how to either chain them or use them separately. It's all a learning curve.

### Day 21: 4 September 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued with *Algorithms* on fCC.

**Thoughts:** Not feeling it today but I still managed to complete 2 Algorithm challenges. Just not where I should be mentally and need a new strategy for this week.

### Day 22: 5 September 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued with *Algorithms* on fCC.

**Thoughts:** I am feeling a little discouraged with the algorithms as I still find them difficult to fully comprehend. I feel like I am rushing the process and that may be the reason I am feeling the way that I am but this feeling will pass and I will get back to the feeling I started with. I have also realised that feelings can be misleading and I need to remember that I have a long to go before fully understanding JavaScript and need to be patient with myself.

### Day 23: 6 September 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued with *Algorithms* on fCC and read up on some methods from **[dive.into.javascript](http://www.diveintojavascript.com/)**.

**Thoughts:** Feeling better about the JavaScript. Just have to read up more and DO more with JavaScript so that I am practising the different methods and callbacks more. I have been seriously hard on myself and need to be a little more gentle and know that everyday is better than the last as I am learning new concepts daily. I believe that I should read up more on methods and callbacks so that I know when to use them. I will be doing more exercises and tutorials on the matter.
