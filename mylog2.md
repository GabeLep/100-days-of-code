# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 14 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Restarted my count for the #100DaysOfCode because I had missed Friday and Sunday. I decided to stick to the rules and rather restart instead of cheating myself in the end. I got through the basics of JavaScript variables and operators. Before restarting, I did complete my fCC Personal Portfolio Page.

**Thoughts:** As simple as they variables and operators are, they are very important as they are the basis of JavaScript logic, in my thinking. I think it is also very important to **PLAN** your time effciently because you will easily miss the time for your coding and before you know it, you will go **DAYS** without coding. I'm glad I got back quickly and not have given too much time. I will continue daily to learn and build projects as that is the promise I made to myself.

### Day 2: 15 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** I began with some of the JacaScript learning at it was difficult at first but I go through it. 

**Thoughts:** Felt better with today. I was struggling to get through some of the JavaScript but I decided to slow down, think about the problem and what I want to see and then it became easier. This reminds me that you cannot rush through a problem but have to take the time to creatively think about it and for it to make sense, even if you have to write it on paper first before creating the code for it.

### Day 3: 16 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed some fCC learning on Arrays, including *.push(), .pop.(), .shift() and .unshift()*. 

**Thoughts:** Really struggled in the beginning but I managed to get through it because I decided to stick it out, no matter how difficult the problem may look. Also learnt that I learn better when I write things on paper first before I type them out. I guess that is how I am wired and I enjoy it. I have an fCC booklet FULL of notes to help me remember and it has really become something I cherish.

**Consistency is key!!!**
